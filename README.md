This is my first solo, non-school related side project; the goal of this is to make a website that I can use as my resume.

## Requirements:
* Include an "about me" page that lists my contact information along with a bit of a summary of my experience
* Have a page detailing previous projects I have worked on as well as the github repo links and/or website links

## Optional Requirements:
* Have a sort feature on the project page
* Have each project as a separate drop down


## To-Do
* Fix the download button on the about me page
* Fix the third column in the skills/qualifications page
* Make QR codes for github repository links, mostly for paper resume (semi-optional) 
* Add padding between the drop down text and the new dropdown in the projects page (optional)
* Change the name into Resume Website (optional)
