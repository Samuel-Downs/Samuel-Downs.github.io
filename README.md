This is my first solo, non-school related side project; the goal of this is to make a website that I can use as my resume.

## Requirements:
* Include an "about me" page that lists my contact information along with a bit of a summary of my experience
* Have a page detailing previous projects I have worked on as well as the github repo links and/or website links
* After the site is finnished, debug everything so it works on mobile

## Optional Requirements:
* Have a sort feature on the project page
* Have each project as a separate drop down


## To-Do
* Fix the download button on the about me page (resolved, but keep a lookout on it)
* Fix the third column in the skills/qualifications page
* Organize the Music Classification Repository and add descriptions to its README.md
* Organize the Music Classification notebook 
* Make QR codes for github repository links, mostly for paper resume (semi-optional) 
* Add padding between the drop down text and the new dropdown in the projects page (optional)
* Change the name into Resume Website (optional)

## VSCode installs:
* Python (allow the installer to add python.exe to PATH; youtube link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkVLNvFh0-M)
* Python extension on vscode (requires a restart afterwards)
* pip install panel jupyter_bokeh altair vega_datasets ipykernel 
* if previous pip install did not work (in the terminal), enter: python -m ensurepip --default-pip
* also: pip install pyodide
