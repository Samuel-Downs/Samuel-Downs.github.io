            <h3>Project Description:</h3>
        <p>In this project, my team designed a workshop with the goal on increasing interest in
            Information Technology as a whole; there was a total of four workshops  (three with freshman classes and one with middle schoolers)
            where we taught our audience how to play sounds using a makey makey controller through scratch
            to then teach basic sound editing on audacity.

        <h3>Project Description:</h3>
        <p>In this project, I colaborated with two other people to make a text based adventure game while following the
            Waterfall model of the Software development life cycle (SDLC).
           Although this project is incomplete and not compileable, I learned these tidbits from working on the project:
           <li>Collabing with other people while using Github</li>
           <li>A better understanding for why object-oriented programming is good for working with other people</li>
           <li>SQLite</li>
           <li>Java</li>
           <li>Waterfall methodology and its weaknesses experienced first-hand</li>
