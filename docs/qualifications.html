                        <p>The United States Information Technology Colligiate Conference is a 3-day national competition in which different colleges 
                            throughout the nation fund a trip (in this case, to Plano, Texas) for a chosen group of students. <br>
                            During this conference, there are 3 competition blocks that feature 2 3/4 hour across a variaty of IT subjects
                            such as database design, system design, business analytics, etc. <br>
                            For my school, 12 students were chosen through a couple of 1-2 hour tests and after being accepted (as well as doing the nessesary paperwork for travel)
                            are required to attend multiple training/practice sessions taught by our professor(s).

                        <p>The Consortium for Computing Sciences in Colleges Southeastern Regional (which in 2023 was hosted in South Carolina by Furman University) is a 2-day conference 
                            separated into two parts: 
                            <ul>
                                <li><b>Student Research:</b> This event is similar to a science fair (but for IT related subjects) where
                                    groups of students set-up a poster at an assigned spot where the student(s) (max students per group is 4) 
                                    talk about the project they have been working on over the semester as well as the results of the project
                                    to visitors/students/judges in front of a poster the students made and set-up. The project my group presented is called "Monster Makey" and information
                                    about this project can be found in the "Monster Makey" drop-down in the "Previous Projects" section of this webpage. <br>
                                </li>
                                <li><b>Programming:</b> There is a 3/4 hour Programming competition where students earn points through solving practice problems.
                                Each group has a maximum of 4 students however only 2 students can be in the competition room at a time; the students cannot use
                                any IDE outside of the room (but you can inside the room). The competition site is set up similarly to CodingBat where the code is tested against multiple inputs;
                                you can test the code with a provide sample, but when submitting the code tests against unknown inputs. When submitted code is marked as incorrect a hint appears
                                about what went wrong (ex. formatting issue, runtime error, etc) and points are deducted from the group's total score.

                            During 2020's game jam at Georgia State University, each team was required to make a game centered around sound/music.
